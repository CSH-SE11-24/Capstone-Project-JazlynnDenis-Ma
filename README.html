My project was to design a website for my local chinese food restaurant, and the target audience were the elderly population that lives in my neighborhood
I am most proud of the logo because it took alot of effort to size and position and i believe it makes it look more realistic 
If i had more time, i would have added more food items but i left it as it was because i liked the simple look
I added a button that would change the font enlarge the text throughtout the homepage. I also made it so when the user hovers over the card on the foodpage, the text would also be enlarged.
Last time, many said that my images were blurry so i tried my best to find better ones.
